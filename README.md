# Crow's Feet Severity Reduction Study

## Overview

This repository contains the data and analysis for a 28-day study evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention in reducing the severity of crow's feet among a diverse group of subjects. The study aimed to assess the impact of the treatment across different demographic groups, including sex and race.

## Study Details

- **Duration**: 28 days
- **Participants**: 32 subjects (17 males, 15 females)
- **Racial Composition**: Caucasian (37.5%), Asian (37.5%), Black (12.5%), Bi-racial (12.5%)
- **Assessment Points**: Day 0 (baseline), Day 14 (midpoint), Day 28 (conclusion)
- **Severity Scale**: 0 (no wrinkles) to 9 (severe wrinkles)

## Key Findings

1. Significant reduction in mean severity scores from 6.03 (Day 0) to 5.0 (Day 28)
2. Statistically significant decrease in crow's feet severity (p < 0.05)
3. Variations in treatment response across different demographic groups
