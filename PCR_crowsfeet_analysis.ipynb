    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Background on Crow's Feet Wrinkles\n",
    "Crow's feet, often referred to as laugh lines, are small wrinkles that emerge at the outer corners of the eyes. They are among the first signs of aging to appear on the face, primarily resulting from the loss of collagen and elasticity in the skin. Various factors contribute to the development and deepening of crow's feet, including but not limited to, repeated facial expressions (like smiling or squinting), sun exposure, smoking, and dehydration. These wrinkles can range from fine lines to more pronounced creases, depending on numerous individual factors, including genetics and lifestyle choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective of the Study\n",
    "The primary objective of this study is to assess the reduction in crow's feet severity over a 28-day period across a cohort of subjects and to explore potential correlations between the extent of reduction and demographic factors such as sex and race. The study will also aim to identify any potential differences in the reduction of crow's feet severity across different demographic groups."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "### Data Description\n",
    "The data is divided into two parts:\n",
    "1. **Crow's Feet Depth Data:** Measurements of crow's feet depth for 32 subjects at three different times (Day 0, Day 14, Day 28).\n",
    "    - Subject Number:\n",
    "      - Serves as a unique identifier for each participant in the study.\n",
    "    - Day 0, Day 14, Day 28 (Severity Scores):\n",
    "      - Represents the crow's feet severity score for each subject at three timepoints.\n",
    "        - Day 0: Baseline measurement before any treatment or intervention.\n",
    "        - Day 14: Intermediate measurement to track progress midway through the study period.\n",
    "        - Day 28: Final measurement to assess the overall change in severity after 28 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Demographic Data:** Information on the sex and race of the subjects.\n",
    "    - Sex:\n",
    "      - Indicates the biological sex of each participant.\n",
    "    - Race: \n",
    "      - Categorizes participants into racial groups such as Asian, Caucasian, Black, and Bi-racial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of the Grading Scale for Crow's Feet Severity\n",
    "\n",
    "The severity of crow's feet was quantified using a numerical scale at each timepoint. This scale includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**0 (No Wrinkles):** No visible signs of crow's feet, indicating no wrinkle development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1-3 (Mild Wrinkles):** Slight evidence of wrinkle formation that may be more apparent when smiling or engaging the muscles around the eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4-7 (Moderate Wrinkles):** Clearly visible wrinkles that are apparent even without facial muscle engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8-9 (Severe Wrinkles):** Deep and extensive wrinkle formation, indicating significant aging or damage to the skin around the eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure for Measuring Crow's Feet at Each Timepoint\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants' crow's feet were evaluated at baseline (Day 0), at the midpoint (Day 14), and at the end of the observation period (Day 28). The procedure for these assessments likely involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Baseline Measurement (Day 0):** Participantsâ€™ crow's feet were assessed and recorded to establish a baseline for comparison against future measurements. This initial assessment was crucial for observing the natural state of the crow's feet without any treatment effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Midpoint Assessment (Day 14):** A follow-up assessment was conducted two weeks into the study to observe any early signs of change in the severity of the crow's feet. This would help in understanding the initial response to the treatment or intervention being assessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Assessment (Day 28):** The last assessment was performed after 28 days to determine the final state of the crow's feet after the treatment period. This measurement was critical for assessing the efficacy of the intervention over a short-term period."
